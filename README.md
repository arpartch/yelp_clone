# yelp_clone
This a yelp clone the utalizes Postgres and Express to add, store, and update restaurants as wells as their ratings.

## Description
A Yelp clone with Postgres, Express, React, and Node.js

## Motivation
This is an opportunity to practice my work with the backend of development by learning the PERN stack by building a Yelp clone. It allows customers to input restraunts they have been to and add a star rating for that restaurant. 

## Challenges and Solutions
## Build status
Build status of continuous integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the ```API``` you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise. To indicate code, use three back ticks before and after code.  It will look like this: ```index.html```

## Installation
npm init
npm install express
npm intall -g nodemon

## API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the ```README```. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the ```API``` reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they'll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.
